"At the age of 13, the female terton Jomo Menmo, an incarnation of Yeshe "
"Tsogyal, discovered the hidden treasure teaching of the <em>Khandro Sangwa "
"Kündü, the Gathering of the Dakini’s Secrets</em>. Through its practice, in "
"the year 1283, she achieved the rainbow body at the age of 36."

"Then, as recounted by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche in his <em>History of the "
"Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism</em>: “This great secret which is so "
"amazing, remained in the possession of the ḍākinīs for some time, and was "
"beyond the reach and range of ordinary persons. The time to train beings by "
"means of it came later in this age of strife, when, by the power of "
"compassion and enlightened aspirations, the transmission of its words and "
"meaning fell to the treasure finder Padma Ösel Do-ngak Lingpa (Jamyang "
"Khyentse Wangpo, 1820-1892). This is because, first and foremost, during his "
"past life as Guru Chökyi Wangchuk, one of the five great terton kings, Jomo "
"Menmo had been his secret friend, and also due to his being blessed by the "
"ḍākinīs of pristine cognition...”"

"This practice of Vajravārāhī is one of the most beautiful and elaborated "
"among ḍākinī sādhanas and is renowned for it’s power to restore the "
"degeneration of the elements—earth, water, air and the others, and to quell "
"the ravages of disease, famine and war. Due to its short lineage of "
"transmission, in our present times the blessings of this practice remain "
"fresh and potent. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche will bestow the ripening "
"empowerment."

"One must be engaged in Vajrayana Buddhist practice to attend the Khandro "
"Sangdü Drubchen. Although numerous measures and commitments establish the "
"foundation for Vajrayana, perhaps the clearest are the four practice "
"authorizations one receives through the four initiations<sup>1</sup> given "
"in an inner tantra<sup>2</sup> empowerment. If you have received such an "
"empowerment and have maintained your respect and devotion to the qualified "
"Vajra lineage holder who bestowed the transmission, you have fulfilled the "
"requirement to attend. Empowerment into Guru Rinpoche, especially from a "
"Treasure Teaching, is particularly auspicious."

"The three inner vehicles of Vajrayana are Maha, Anu, and Ati Yoga, and "

"empowerment, but do not fulfill the requirement for this Drubchen. If you "
"wish to attend, you should receive a inner tantra empowerment before "
"December."
